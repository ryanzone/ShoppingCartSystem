# Project #
The Shopping Cart System is a desktop-based application developed using Java (Swing) for the 
frontend and SQLite for the backend database. 

This project provides a simplified digital shopping experience where users can create an account, 
browse products, add items to their cart, and complete their purchase securely. 
The frontend interface is designed with a focus on user-friendliness, modern UI design, and 
smooth navigation between windows.
Each module: Login, Signup, View Browse, Cart, 
Purchase, and Receipt, works together to simulate a real-world shopping workflow. 
The backend ensures data persistence by storing user details, product information, and 
transaction history using SQLite, which allows for lightweight and efficient data management 
without requiring an external server. 

The system demonstrates the integration of GUI-based application development and database 
connectivity in Java, providing a practical example of combining frontend and backend 
technologies in a single cohesive project. 
This application can be extended further by integrating features like search filtering, admin 
management, and online payment gateways in future iterations. 




# Tech Stack #

● Programming Language: Java (JDK 8 or above) – core language for application 
logic. 

● Graphical User Interface (GUI): Java Swing and AWT – for building windows, 
buttons, tables, and interactive components. 

● Database: SQLite  lightweight, file-based database for storing user, product, and 
transaction data. 

● IDE (Integrated Development Environment): IntelliJ IDEA – for coding, 
debugging, and project management. 

● Database Connectivity: SQLite JDBC Driver – enables Java programs to 
interact with SQLite databases. 

● Layout Managers: BorderLayout, FlowLayout, GridLayout – used for arranging 
GUI components dynamically. 

● Event Handling: ActionListener, MouseListener – for handling button clicks and 
user interactions. 

● File Handling: Java IO classes (File, FileWriter, BufferedReader) – for 
reading/writing receipts or logs.
